When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

   I would want to use a remote repository when I am working on a team or making changers from another computer. Speacially if we are in different locations.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    Because git could commit a change that we don't want to show yet.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    I will use forks when i want to modify a file on github that i don't have acces to clone.
    I will use clone when i want to modify a file on my computer that i have acces to and know the URL.
    I will use a branch when i want to experiment new features and i want to keep the original version working

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    So that you could work offline

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

  I would colaborate by using dropbox or sending a lot of emails. Working with git and github simplifies coding sharing a lot.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?

When you want  other people to collaborate, comment, and add code to your project. This way you'll be able to initiate a pull request from GitHub.

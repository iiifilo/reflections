How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?
It helped me by showing just the piece of code that was modified, excluding the rest.  

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

   So i can restore to an older version in case i make a mistake and i don't loose precious information.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    Pros: I can use any editor, work offline and do a manual saving. 
    Cons: I can forget to do a commit while google docs make them automatically

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    To keep files that are interrelated together

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    By Using the command log you will see the history of the commits where you can see the description. And by using the command diff you will be able to find the difference between 2 files, you can see how many there were addes and removed.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    Using version control make me more confident because this way i'm sure that a have a previous version saved which was working. allowing me to find the exact point where a change was made and then letting me compare the files so I can find a bug in a few steps.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    I'll use everytime i will do coding, so that i get used to it as fast as possible.
